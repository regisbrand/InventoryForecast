Person B: No.  I have one more semester, but it would be great to have a job lined up. Person A: How is your day going? Person B: Quite busy.  I'm preparing for my presentation tomorrow on our marketing strategy.  I'm not even half done yet. Person A: You must feel stressed out now. Person B: That's an understatement. Person A: What are you doing now? Person B: I'm playing pool with my friends at a pool hall. Person A: I didn't know you play pool.  Are you having fun? Person B:  I'm having a great time.  How about you?  What are you doing? Person A: I'm taking a break from my homework.  There seems to be no end to the amount of work I have to do. Person B: I'm glad I'm not in your shoes."
